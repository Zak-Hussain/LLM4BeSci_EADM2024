    "\n",
    "In this exercise---inspired by  [Wulff & Mata, 2023](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/9h7aw)---we will use an LLM to extract features (embeddings) from personality items. We will then use these features to compute the similarity between items, evaluate how well these predict observed similarities, and visualize the similarity matrix in two dimensions. Finally, we will assign each item to a personality construct based on its similarity to the constructs.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this analysis, you will have learned how:\n",
    "- To extract features from text using an LLM\n",
    "- To compute the similarity between items using cosine similarity\n",
    "- How this can be used to predict the construct to which an item belongs, and thus potentially improve construct validity"

We use the `sklearn`'s `cosine similarity` function, which measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. The closer the cosine similarity is to 1, the more similar the two items are.
